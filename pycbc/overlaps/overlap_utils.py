def filter_by_padding(htilde, stilde, psd, fmin, target_sample_rate,

    """
    A wrapper around pycbc.filter's matched_filter_core. This function
    zero-pads htilde and stilde out to the Nyquist frequency of the target
    sample rate before filtering. The resulting overlap time series is sampled
    at the target sample rate rather than the sample rate at which h and s were
    sampled (which should be smaller). This does not recover any power from
    frequencies higher than h and s's sampling rates; it assumes that either h
    or s have zero power in the frequencies above their Nyquist frequency.  The
    goal of this is to get the overlap in points in between the sampled points,
    so that the maximum can be recovered more precisely.
    
    If need be, the psd will also be padded, though 1's will be used. The psd's
    Nyquist must be greater than or equal to the minimum of htilde and stilde's
    Nyquist frequency. The Nyquist frequency of each series is assumed to be
    len(series)*series.delta_f.

    Note that the Nyquist frequencies (and thus the equivalent sampling rates)
    of htilde, stilde, and the psd do not need to be the same. They only need
    to have the same frequency resolution (that is, the same delta_f).

    If htilde or stilde have a Nyquist frequency larger than the target sample
    rate's, a ValueError is raised. If htilde and stilde have the same Nyquist
    frequency as the target sample rate's, they are passed directly to the
    matched_filter_core.

    Parameters
    ----------
    htilde: FrequencySeries
        The template waveform.
    stilde: FrequencySeries
        The injection or data.
    psd: (real) FrequencySeries
        The psd. The Nyquist frequency of this must be >= min(htilde's Nyquist,
        stilde's Nyquist).
    fmin: float
        The lower frequency cutoff to use when performing the filtering.
    target_sample_rate: int
        The desired sample rate of the matched-filter time series.
    work_v1: {None, FrequencySeries}, optional
        Work-space frequency series to use for htilde when performing
        the filtering. Must have the same frequency resolution as htilde, and
        must have a length N/2+1 where N = target_sample_rate/htilde.delta_f.
        If None specified, one will be generated.
    work_v2: {None, FrequencySeries}, optional
        Same as work_v1, but for stilde.
    work_psd: {None, (real) FrequencySeries}, optional
        Same as work_v1, but for the psd.
    high_frequency_cutoff: {None, float}, optional
        Passed through to matched_filter_core; see that documentation for help.
    h_norm: {None, float}, optional
        Passed through to matched_filter_core; see that documentation for help.

        Passed through to matched_filter_core; see that documentation for help.

    A wrapper around pycbc.filter's matched_filter_core that uses

    rate of the cmplx_snr is >= target sample rate, the cmplx_snr is returned

    depends on ratio of the target sample rate to the input rate (the scale
    factor) and the size of the resampling length to the length of the

    segment length of 256s, this function was found to be ~ (5/8) * the scale

    htilde: FrequencySeries
        The template waveform.
    stilde: FrequencySeries

    psd: (real) FrequencySeries
        The PSD.
    fmin: float
        The lower frequency cutoff to use when performing the filtering.
    target_sample_rate: int
        The desired sample rate of the matched-filter time series.
    max_resample_length: int
        Number of (integer) seconds to use for resampling. Default is 2.
        See the documentation of upsample_timeseries for more details.
    check_error: bool, optional
        If set to True, the maximum of abs(cmplx_snr*norm) of the resampled
        series is compared to the result from filter_by_padding. *WARNING:*
        turning this on will negate any computational savings. This
        option is only meant as a check. Default is False.
    high_frequency_cutoff: {None, float}, optional

        If set to True and stilde and htilde do not have the same Nyquist
        frequency (i.e., one frequency series is shorter than the other),
        than the shorter one will be zero-padded to the same length as the
        longer one then filtered using filter_by_padding. This assumes
        that the shorter one has no power at frequencies greater than the
        given Nyquist. The resulting cmplx_snr time series will then be
        upsampled to the target sample rate. If this is set to False,
        an error will be raised if stilde and htilde are not the same length.
    work_v1: {None, FrequencySeries}, optional
        If zero_pad_to_common_Nyquist is set to True, this is passed to
        work_v1 option in filter_by_padding to speed up filtering on repeated
        calls. The Nyquist frequency of this vector must be the same as the
        common Nyquist between htilde and stilde, which can be found using
        get_common_Nyquist. If this is not provided, an appropriately sized
        vector will be generated. See filter_by_padding for more details.
    work_v2: {None, FrequencySeries}, optional
        Same as work_v1, but for stilde. See filter_by_padding for more
        details.
    work_psd: {None, (real) FrequencySeries}, optional
        Same as work_v1, but for the psd. See filter_by_padding for more
        details.

    Returns

        A time series containing the complex snr. This will have a sample rate

        the target sample rate (meaning resampling was done), the cmplx_snr
        will only consist of the resampled part.
    corrrelation: FrequencySeries
        A frequency series containing the correlation vector. The length of this will be
        equal to the segment length times the *original* sample_rate, not the resampled
        rate (i.e., it is the correlation vector you get from matched_filter_core).
    norm : float

    A glue.segments.segment that adds additional arguments to quickly check if

    window given some parameter window. For example, if you wanted to only
    filter templates that were within -10%, +20% of an injection's chirp mass
    for injections that had chirp masses between 8 and 12 solar masses, you
